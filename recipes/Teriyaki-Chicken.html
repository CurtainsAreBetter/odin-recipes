        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This recipe is meant to mimic the teritaki flavor you might find at a Panda Express. It's good but it also uses more sugar than the average European eats in a day (that's a guess). Eating the chicken, when properly marinated, without the sauce is a perfectly enjoyable meal too! Do what you want, eat the chicken raw if you feel so inclined. This goes well with rice or steam vegetables, probably some other things to but I'm not a chef."</p>
