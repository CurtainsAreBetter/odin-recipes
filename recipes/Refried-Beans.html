        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Refried beans are a super easy dish to make that I can never get right! I can make a strudel without a hitch but somehow getting the flavor right with some mashed up pinto beans is just too much to ask from me. You too can enjoy the frustration of spending a whole day thinking about your beans only to find out that they are yet another disappointment!</p>

        <!-- Ingredients -->

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Rinse the beans</li>
            <li>Soak the beans overnight. Have the water reach about two knuckles above the top of the beans</li>

            <li>Place beans, onion, garlic, and the 6 cups of water into a large pot and set heat to high</li>

            <li>Stir the contents of the pot again and 30 minutes to 1 hour until beans are very soft</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet</li>
            <li>Ladle beans onto skillet and begin to mash/ fry</li>
            <li>Add bean broth to skillet for desired consistency</li>
            <li>Once desired consistency is met, enjoy!</li>
            <li>Google how to clean a skillet because you always are worried you'll do it wrong</li>
