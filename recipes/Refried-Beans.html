        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Refried beans are a super easy dish to make that I can never get right! I can make a strudel without a hitch but somehow getting the flavor right with some mashed up pinto beans is just too much to ask from me. You too can enjoy the frustration of spending a whole day thinking about your beans only to find out that they are yet another disappointment!</p>
