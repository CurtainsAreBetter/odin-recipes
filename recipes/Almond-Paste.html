            <p>You've heard of paste, you've heard of almonds, from the makers of marzipan it's: <em>Almond Paste!</em> This recipe is essentially an americanized marzipan. I like it better than marzipan because I think rose water is a nice color but once you get into the whole baking scene it seems like more work than it's worth. Call me a sinner, if you can, I'll enjoy my marzipan. Also, still going to use rose water I guess.</p>
